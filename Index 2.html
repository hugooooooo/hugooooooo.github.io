        <h1>Dream Book</h1>
        <p class="lead">This was my third project at General Assembly UX Design Immersive. The purpose of the project was to create a visual style for project 1</p>

          <h4 id="TheProblem">
          The problem</h4>
          <p>How to find the right look and feel for the app I created in project 1 to help people interpret their dreams.</p>

          <h4>Design approach</h4>
          
          <p> To understand what the app should look like I first had to resolve the main aim for the app. At this point there were three different features:</p>

          <p> 
          </p><ul>
          <li>A list of dream archetypes and their meanings that people can browse through for instructional purposes</li>

          <li>A chat room or a phone call system to contact a specialist therapist to help give meaning to a particular dream under the person’s current circumstances</li>

          <li>A dream journal where people could store their dreams and respective interpretations generated by the above features</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Feature 3 being a common feature in the app market was immediately put at the back of the project and offered as a suplementar feature. I decided then to focus on feature 1 and 2 only. I interviewed a group of users asking them which of them they would rather use. The answers fell on both sides so I thought of using a main design style to shell a secundary level design. The main design would be around the feature 1 since it was the most required and feature 2 would use a different design with some of the same visual elements of the first but with a different feel to it.
          </p>

          <h4>Key requirements</h4>
          <p> To enhance the experience of dream interpretation with a matching visual style. For feature 1 the user interviews revealed that a fun, light visual style would be more appropriate. For feature 2 people would rather have a serious, neutral look “ rather have a simple clear, no nonsense design rather than blue skyies or anything like that. Black and white, very straight and professional looking.” With some research I realised that dreams can sometimes reveal traumatic episodes of the past that people repressed to their unconscious. Therefore it would be important to develop a visual design that is gentle and appropriate to those circumstances for feature 2.
          </p>

        <h4 id="Method">Method and testing results</h4>

        <p>For feature 1 using words associations I concluded the following main (A) qualities and (B) objects: (A) Calm/Quiet/Misterious/Blured/Light (B) Night/Cloud/Sky/Quarter Crescent/ Hot air balloon/ Pillow</p>
        <p> <img width="400px" src="./Index 2_files/Word_Association.jpg"> 
            </p>
            <p>I asked for some feedback from the prototype of the content only first without much stylistic elements to it and I concluded that I had to clean lots of elements out of them since I wasn’t make it clear the real content of the pages.</p>
        
            <p>Once I decided what content would be in the different pages then I started playing with the moodboard elements and deciding the typefaces that should go with them.
        
            Due to time constraints I decided to focus on Feature 1’s visual feel and logo only and leave Feature 2 for a later stage.</p>
        
            <p>Once I built my prototype with all the stylistic elements I proceeded to my second user test and the words chosen matched the original ones (calm, playful, reliable and neutral). The animals and professions association was also very successful. The element that people had more problems with was the logo. Most of them didn’t understand what the logo meant with a cloud as a speech bubble so I redesigned that element to make it look more like a book since that concept was more accurate than the previous one.</p>

        <h4>Final resolution</h4>

        <p>The look and feel of the app was what was intended and had a great response from the users. The calm, blurred visual note emphasises the experience of  solving the meaning of a mystic intriguing dream on a more light fun approach.

        <h4>Next steps</h4>

        <p>To develop the look of Feature 2 or "Analysis Room” and test the second version of the logo.</p>
